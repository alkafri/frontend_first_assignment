<!-- 
  The ingredients measurements method is different from ingredient to another, (L, ML, Spoon, Cup, dl and so on)
  I set the number of the start portion is 2, and the change of amount should be changed by 2 only.
  If the change happen in different values (such as 3, 5 or even 1), this can cause an unreasonable value
  such as 1.13 spoon!
